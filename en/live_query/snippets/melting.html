        Creating Melt Requests

    <summary>
        Here we learn how to create melt requests whereby a User may destroy an Item and receive what amount of Enjin Coin had been staked to it at
        its creation.

        <p>
            This method, given an access token, will send a request to the Cloud Platform which creates a request to melt an Item. The sender will be
            given the option to either accept or deny the melt operataion in the Enjin Wallet. This second factor of accepting or denying the transfer
            request on a separate service is a security feature to protect against potentially malicious developers, server proxies, or compromised
            machines.

                Creating a melt request on the Cloud Platform requires specifying an identifier for the sender's Identity, an identifier for the Item
                being melted, and an amount of that Item to melt. Once this request appears in the sender's wallet and is accepted, the Items
                specified in the request will be melted to unlock their staked Enjin Coin. The GraphQL query to do so is as follows:

            <p>
                In this example query, we have issued a melt request for the sender to either accept or deny using their Enjin Wallet. The
                corresponding function in the Unity SDK to this GraphQL call is <a

                userIdentityID, string itemID, int amount, System.Action&lt;RequestEvent&gt; callback)</a> which will create an identical melt request
                as well as register a callback for listening to the User accepting. This callback can be used in similar fashion to the "Linking a
                Wallet" example.

	<p>
		Welcome to the documentation for the Enjin SDK. Here you will find useful instructions for interacting with the tools we provide to make the true
		ownership of in-game items possible. This page is a customized landing menu to explore general, useful GraphQL queries with links to their
		equivalent functions in Unity. If you'd like to explore the full automatically-generated Unity documentation, feel free to peruse the included <a

	<h2>About the Cloud Platform</h2>

	<p>
		The Cloud Platform is Enjin's intermediary server to make interacting with our deployed ERC-1155 smart contract implementation easier.
	</p>

    <p>
        Cloud Platforms are deployed to specific URLs and listen for POSTed GraphQL queries. In this documentation, the Cloud Platform at the
        following URL will be queried:
    </p>

    <input id="platform-url" type="text" disabled>

	<h2>Operations Involving Users</h2>

	<p>
		Users are an abstraction on the Cloud Platform for someone with login details. This encompasses someone who might be a Player, an Admin, or a
		Platform Owner. Players are Users who do not have any special permissions within a single app. They are normal, unelevated, and the majority
		of Users. Admins are Users with elevated permissions within a single app, typically the developer. This is a good Role to assign to something
		like a server which proxies requests on behalf of Players. Platform Owners have elevated privileges across an entire Cloud Platform. A use
		case for such a Role is an over-arching developer Role which wants to access multiple items from multiple individual apps on that single
		instance of a Cloud Platform. More generally, Roles are custom collections of permissions that can be created and attached to specific Users
		in order to restrict some parts of the SDK functionality. The Player, Admin, and Platform Owner permissions described here represent what is
		available as default Roles.

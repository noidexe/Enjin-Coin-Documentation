	 Newly-created Identities include codes that players can enter in the Enjin Wallet to link an Ethereum address for handling Items.

      In the Unity SDK, the intended workflow for linking a User's wallet to an Identity such that your game might retrieve their Ethereum address is to register a listening callback and display a linking code. The User will then enter this code in their Enjin Wallet, at which time your callback function will be triggered. The code can be retrieved from the "linking_code" field of the appropriate Identity under the User object returned from methods such as <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#abd0ebc7f68d479d83a8d365c52d35993" target="_blank">Enjin.VerifyLogin(string username, string password)</a> or <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#ad3766c8ed4e8fdb68f065177d4046027" target="_blank">CreateUser(string username, string email, string password, string role)</a>. If the Identity has already been linked, then the "linking_code" field will be null and an "ethereum_address" will be present.

      An example of the Unity SDK's <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#a5935d76a851168b2b5c5a15f0bef753e" target="_blank">Enjin.ListenForLink(int identityID, System.Action&lt;RequestEvent&gt; listener)</a> where "identityId" is the identifier of a specific Identity under a User which you as developer would like to listen for linking on. That is, this is the Identity containing the code which you should be displaying to the player. The "linkingData" parameter is an object of type <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_request_event.html" target="_blank">RequestEvent</a> and includes some potentially-useful metadata about the linking event.

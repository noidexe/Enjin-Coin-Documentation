        Getting Access Credentials
    </h1>
    <summary>
        Most functionality that this SDK supports, whether querying Player data or requesting operations on CryptoItems, requires an access token to
        use.

            This method retrieves an access token given a User's credentials. This access token is used by including it in an 'Authorization' header
            on the outbound POST request to Enjin's Cloud Platform. The access token serves to identify the User and makes sure that only those with
            valid permissions can enact Cloud Platform operations. Executing this example will set the access token which is used to validate requests
            for all other examples on this page.

                Logging a User into a Cloud Platform requires their email address and password. The GraphQL query to do so is as follows:

                In the Unity SDK, functionality identical to this call is implemented by the <a
                    href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#ab9af06457f065cebd30f28ef5d20cf92" target="_blank">Enjin.Login(string username,
                string password)</a> method. This method takes the same input of a username and password before returning a User object containing
                that User's id, access token, an array of Roles, and an array of Identities. In a similar vein, the <a
                    href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#abd0ebc7f68d479d83a8d365c52d35993" target="_blank">Enjin.VerifyLogin(string
                username, string password)</a> method performs an identical login query but only returns the User, success state, and does not alter
                global AppID state. Its purpose is to validate the correct login of a User for game servers which are proxying requests. The SDK also
                includes <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#accf26efc6912b460998fd39e471e8acb" target="_blank">StartPlatform()</a>
                methods which initialize the SDK as a whole to a specific Cloud Platform with a specific User to issue requests, which is very useful
                for signing in with a managing Admin.

        Creating a New User
    </h1>
    <summary>
        A game developer can, using their privileged Admin User, create additional Users for their players.
    </summary>
    <div>
        <p>
            This method, given an Admin's access token, will send a request to the Cloud Platform which creates a new User and Identity with the
            specified details. This Identity will need to be linked at some point to a Player's wallet using the Enjin Wallet App before it can be
            particularly useful. The use case for this sort of User creation is to let game developers leverage the Cloud Platform as a kind of
            authorization and credentials backend in supporting User login.
        </p>

                Creating a new User on the Cloud Platform requires specifying a name, password, unique email, and role. All fields are specified as
                text strings, with the Role matching an existing value known to the Cloud Platform. The User is created under the specified App that
                the caller is an Admin of. The GraphQL query to do so is as follows:
            </p>

            {{ CreateUserExample }}

            <p>
                In this example query, we have created a new User on the Cloud Platform. In order for this call to succeed, the caller must have
                permissions to create Users on their App. Typically, this is done by letting the caller have the Admin or Platform Owner Roles. This
                new User is automatically created with a single Identity for the caller's App. The corresponding function in the Unity SDK to this
                GraphQL call is <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#ad3766c8ed4e8fdb68f065177d4046027" target="_blank">CreateUser(string
                username, string email, string password, string role)</a> which will create a new User with new Identity and return it such that we
                might link it to a Player's wallet.

            This method, given a User's access token, will send a request to the Cloud Platform which returns a User's inventory for a specified
            Identity. An Identity is tied to a single wallet address, and a User can have many of them across different Cloud Platform apps. Users can
            also have a single Identity with items from multiple apps.

                Retrieving a User's inventory from the Cloud Platform requires knowing the ID for an Identity of theirs. The GraphQL query to do so is
                as follows:
            </p>

            {{ ItemsExample }}

            <p>
                In this example query, we have retrieved the first page of a User's inventory from the Cloud Platform. Please note that the "page"
                parameter may be changed to query for additional items as desired by your game's needs. The corresponding function in the Unity SDK to
                this GraphQL call is <a href="doxygen/class_enjin_s_d_k_1_1_enjin.html#a91d65b738b2b58ede69122afb8e83501" target="_blank">Enjin.GetAllItems(int
                identityID)</a> which will return a workable list of all Items tied to an Identity and their relevant metadata.

## Command List

* `account new`
* `account import <PRIVATE KEY>`
* `link <CODE>`
* `run`
* `backup <FILENAME>`
* `decrypt`
* `decrypt <FILENAME>`

## account new

Create a new account for this wallet. The wallet _must_ not already have an address. If it does, this command will do nothing and you will get an error.

If you want to create a new wallet address, you have to move or rename the storage file first.

Example:
```
node src/main.js account new
```

## acount import

This command takes a single argument: the private key to use with the wallet. The format of the private key must be a 160 bit hexadecimal string prefixed with `0x`.

Example:
```
node src/main.js account import 0x37986485ee024917a6cb7748c60d5d58214c7ca6e9a1d5d3880e2d94983012b7
```

## link

Connect the wallet daemon with a trusted platform identity. You can link with many different identities, on many different trusted platforms.

Example:
```
node src/main.js link B3DJF4
```

## run

Start the wallet daemon. This is the default command if none is supplied. The application will keep running until it's stopped (Ctrl-C) or killed.

Example:
```
node src/main.js run
```

## backup

Copy the current storage file to the specified location. The file remains safely encrypted.

Example:
```
node src/main.js backup c:\users\timmy\dropbox\backup\enjin-wallet-daemon-storage.json
```

## decrypt

Read an encrypted storage file and output its content to the console. If no storage file is specified, the default storage is read.

Examples:
```
node src/main.js decrypt d:\backup\ewd-storage.json
node src/main.js decrypt
```
